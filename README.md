# InspiritAI-SkinLesionApp

A project made at [Inspirit AI](https://inspiritai.com) that is made to detect skin cancer.  The website works locally, however, it does not work on heroku for some reason (I'm working on making the heroku deployment work).

It has around 53% accuracy, not much better than a human.  I'm working on improving the model as well, yes.
